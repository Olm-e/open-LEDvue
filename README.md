# open-LEDvue
arduino based led Vuemeter

a high power led vuemeter that is both independant (using onboard microphone) or a usb connection to get sound or other signal level. The leds are driven by PWM and can emote different moods.
This project is great for a living room but mostly usefull for onstage artists willing an easy to setup light effect.
